#### Installing networkx package

Networkx package is available in `.egg` format. In order to install it, you need to install a program that can handle them (`easy_install`)

Download the file the execute `python ez_setup.py`

Once the installation is done, download the package and execute `easy_install networkx1-11-py2.7.egg`
